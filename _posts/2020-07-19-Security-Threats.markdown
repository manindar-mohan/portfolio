As we are going through unusual and challenging times, our daily habit has been affected in all sorts of ways. For those who are working from home, this is indeed a very difficult time. We are more open to cyber attacks due to the little to no cyber security we have in place while working from home.

Hackers are desperately trying to exploit the opportunity and up to some extent, it’s working. It’s mainly because many organizations and business tasks have gone from an internal network to the open internet without much preparation. This has exposed them to more potential threats.

Some of the common attacks are listed below.

* Email-Phishing
* SMS-Phishing
* Mobile Malware
* Malicious Software
* Ransomware Attacks
